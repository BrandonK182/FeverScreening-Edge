Changelog
=========

3.1.1
-----

Improved documentation is now available at https://rules-proto-grpc.aliddell.com


3.1.0
-----

This update mostly brings fixes to the JavaScript rules, along with new rules for generating Markdown, JSON, HTML or
DocBook documentation from .proto files using `protoc-gen-doc <https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc>`_.
Additionally, new ``buf_proto_lint`` and ``buf_proto_breaking`` rules have been added to support linting .proto files and
checking for breaking changes using `Buf <https://buf.build>`_.

General
*******

- Updated protobuf to 3.15.3

Buf
***

- Added linting and breaking change detection rules using `Buf <https://buf.build>`_

Doc
***

- Added documentation rules to generate Markdown, JSON, HTML or DocBook files using
  `protoc-gen-doc <https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc>`_

grpc-gateway
************

- Updated grpc-gateway to 2.3.0
- Fixed issue with mixing .proto files that do and do not contain services
  `#72 <https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/72>`_

JavaScript
**********

- Updated ``rules_nodejs`` to 3.2.1

- Updated ``protobuf`` to 2.22.0


3.0.0
-----

This update brings some major improvements to rules_proto_grpc and solves many of the longstanding issues that have been
present. However, in doing so there have been some changes that make a major version increment necessary and may require
updates to your build files. The updates for each language are explained below and should you have any issues, please
open a new `issue <https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/new>`_ or
`discussion <https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/discussions/new>`_.

The most substantial change is that compilation of .proto files into language specific files is no longer transitive.
This means that only the direct dependencies of a ``lang_proto_library`` will be present within the generated library,
rather than every transitive proto message. The justification for this is below, but if you're just interested in the
changes, you can skip down to the next heading.

In previous versions of rules_proto_grpc, the compilation aspect would compile and aggregate all dependent .proto files
from any top level target. In hindsight, this was not the correct behaviour and led to many bugs, since you may end up
creating a library that contains compiled proto files from a third party, where you should instead be depending on a
proper library for that third party's protos.

Even in a single repo, this may have meant multiple copies of a single compiled proto file being present in a target, if
it is depended on via multiple routes. For some languages, such as C++, this breaks the 'one definition rule' and
produces compilation failures or runtime bugs. For other languages, such as Python, this just meant unnecessary
duplicate files in the output binaries.

Therefore, in this release of rules_proto_grpc, there is now a recommedned option to bundle only the direct proto
dependencies into  the libraries, without including the compiled transitive proto files. This is done by replacing the
``deps`` attr on ``lang_{proto|grpc}_{compile|library}`` with the ``protos`` attr. Since this would be a substantial breaking
change to drop at once on a large project, the new behaviour is opt-in in 3.0.0 and the old method continues to work
throughout the 3.x.x release cycle. Rules using the previous deps attr will have a warning written to console to signify
that your library may be bundling more than expect and should switch attr.

As an additional benefit of this change, we can now support passing arbitrary per-target rules to protoc through the new
``options`` attr of the rules, which was a much sought after change that was impossible in the aspect based compilation.

Switching to non-transitive compilation
***************************************

In short, replace ``deps`` with ``protos`` on your targets:

.. code-block:: python

   # Old
   python_grpc_library(
       name = "routeguide",
       deps = ["//example/proto:routeguide_proto"],
   )

   # New
   python_grpc_library(
       name = "routeguide",
       protos = ["//example/proto:routeguide_proto"],
   )

In applying the above change, you may discover that you were inheriting dependencies transitively and that your builds
now fail. In such cases, you should add a ``lang_{proto|grpc}_{compile|library}`` target for those proto files and
depend on it explicitly from the relevant top level binaries/libraries.

General Changes
***************

- Updated protobuf to 3.15.1
- Updated gRPC to 1.35.0
